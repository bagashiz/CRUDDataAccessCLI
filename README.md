# Description

This is my assignment project for "*Pengembangan Berorientasi Penggunaan Ulang*" (Reusability Oriented Development) course for Information Systems major at [Brawijaya University](https://ub.ac.id) in the 5th semester.

It is a simple CRUD TODO terminal application using [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and a csv file as the persistent storage.
